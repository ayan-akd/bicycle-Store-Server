# Bicycle Store Server

A backend server built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. This API handles bicycle inventory, orders, and revenue calculations. The application supports CRUD operations for bicycles, manages orders with automatic stock updates, and provides a comprehensive error handling mechanism.

## üìã Features

- **Store Bicycle Data**: Store and manage bicycle details in the database.
- **Create, Read, Update, and Delete Bicycle Details**: Fully manage bicycle records via API endpoints.
- **Store Orders**: Create orders and automatically update the stock quantity.
- **Calculate Total Revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders.
- **Search Bicycles**: Retrieve bicycles based on query search terms.
- **Validate User Inputs**: Ensure data integrity using **Zod** for input validation.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for a better user experience.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type annotations for reliability and maintainability of the application.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Use **Mongoose** to interact with MongoDB for efficient data handling and validation.
- **Code Linting & Formatting**: Enforce code quality with **ESLint** and **Prettier** for consistent code style.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x.x)
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git**
- **TypeScript** (Optional: If you prefer to install globally)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bicycle-store-server.git
   cd bicycle-store-server
    ```
2.Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd bicycle-store-server
   npm install
   ```

3.Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection URI:

   ```bash
 MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4.Start the development server:

   ```
npm run start:dev
   ```

The server will run at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if you configure it differently).

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts for development and production:

- `npm run start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the application in development mode with live reloading using `ts-node-dev`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run dev`: Watches for changes and compiles TypeScript files automatically.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using **ESLint**.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors.
- `npm run format`: Formats the codebase using **Prettier**.
- `npm run format:fix`: Automatically fixes formatting issues with **Prettier**.

## API Endpoints

### Products (Bicycles)

- **GET /api/products**: Retrieve a list of all bicycles.
- **GET /api/products/:id**: Retrieve a single bicycle by its ID.
- **POST /api/products**: Add a new bicycle to the inventory.
- **PUT /api/products/:id**: Update the details of a specific bicycle.
- **DELETE /api/products/:id**: Delete a specific bicycle from the inventory.

### Orders

- **POST /api/orders**: Create a new order. Stock will be updated automatically.
- **GET /api/orders//revenue**: Get the total revenue generated from all orders.

### Revenue

- **GET /api/revenue**: Get the total revenue generated from all orders.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js for building the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to facilitate data handling and validation.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for a more reliable and maintainable codebase.
- **Zod**: Schema validation library to ensure input data integrity.
- **ESLint**: Linting tool to enforce consistent coding styles.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to maintain consistent formatting across the codebase.
